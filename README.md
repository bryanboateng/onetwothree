# OneTwoThree

OneTwoThree is a game that challenges your memorization skills.

The game starts with showing you the sequence 1, 2, 3.
You then have to repeat that sequence using your index, middle and ring finger by showing the right amount of fingers into the camera.

In each subsequent round a new digit is shown and the whole sequence including the new digit has to be repeated/pointed into the camera.

Let's see how good your memorization skills are!
