 # OneTwoThree
 OneTwoThree is a game that challenges your memorization skills.
 
 The game starts with showing you the sequence 1, 2, 3.
 You then have to repeat that sequence using your index, middle and ring finger by showing the right amount of fingers into the camera.
 
 In each subsequent round a new digit is shown and the whole sequence including the new digit has to be repeated/pointed into the camera.
 
 
 The game starts when you show your hand at the camera.

  As a guide each of the two fingers is marked either green or red
 
 green: Finger is pointing up
 
 red: Finger is pointing down
 
 - important: Remember to grand XCode/Swift Playgrounds permission to use the camera.
 ---
 - important: Remember: Only the index, middle and ring finger are taken into account. Make sure all three of them are always visible to the camera, it's even better to show your whole hand.
 ---
 - important: The game expects you to show the sequence right after the digit has been shown. So be quick!
